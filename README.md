# Calculator

This repository contains the code for a simple calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports percentage calculations.

## Usage

To use the calculator, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. The calculator interface will be displayed, allowing you to input numbers and perform calculations.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Percentage calculation
- Clear button (`C`) to reset the input
- Delete button (`DEL`) to remove the last entered digit
- Equals button (`=`) to evaluate the expression and display the result

## How It Works

The calculator uses JavaScript to handle user input and perform the calculations. The HTML file defines the structure of the calculator interface, while the CSS file provides the styling.

When a button is clicked, JavaScript functions are called to update the input field with the corresponding value. The `calculate` function appends the clicked number or operator to the input field. The `Result` function evaluates the expression in the input field using the `eval` function and displays the result.

## Styling

The calculator interface is styled using CSS. It features a modern and clean design with rounded buttons and a shadow effect. The input field has a rounded border and a subtle shadow to provide a visually appealing look.

## Dependencies

This project does not have any external dependencies. It only uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are supported by all modern web browsers.

Feel free to modify and use the code for personal or commercial purposes.
